# Introduction
This is a simple Todo application built off Django (including the Django REST Framework for API CRUD operations) and React. For a complete walkthrough, see Build a To-Do application Using Django and React.https://reactjs.org/docs/getting-started.html

# Requirements
    1.Install and set up a local programming environment for Python 3 (https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorial_series/how-to-install-and-set-up-a-local-programming-environment-for-python-3)
    2.Install Node.js and Create a Local Development Environment (https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorial_series/how-to-install-node-js-and-create-a-local-development-environment)
 
# Getting Started

    1. Clone the project to your machine [git clone https://github.com/Sandeepsubramaniyan/To-do-app.git]
    2. Navigate into the directory [cd To-do-app]
    3. Source the virtual environment by using [pipenv shell]
    4. Install the dependencies by using [pipenv install]
    5. Navigate into the frontend directory [cd frontend]
    6. Install the dependencies [npm install]
    
# How to Run the application
    You will need two terminals pointed to the frontend and backend directories to start the servers for this application.

    1.Run this command to start the backend server in the [backend] directory: [python manage.py runserver] (You have to run this command while you are sourced into the virtual environment and address will be http://127.0.0.8000
    2.Run this command to start the frontend development server in the [frontend] directory: [npm install] (This will start the frontend on the adddress localhost:3000)
